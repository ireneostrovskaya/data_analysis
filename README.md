I'd like to share some of my data analysis progects, completed while studying in Masterschool. They contain real databases solving different issues and investigating from preprocessing and EDA to hypothesis testing!
The projects are useful to learn some new tricks in python and data visualztion.
I am always happy to collaborate, improve technical skills and study something new
